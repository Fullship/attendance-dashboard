This file forces a new deployment to apply:
1. DATABASE_URL connection string usage
2. Fixed authentication handling for both 'password' and 'password_hash' columns
3. Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting

Expected results:
- Database connection should succeed
- Authentication should work with any password column name
- Health endpoint should show "connected": true
