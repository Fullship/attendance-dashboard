# ATTENDANCE DASHBOARD - FINAL TESTING SUMMARY

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLUTION COMPLETE

The attendance dashboard system has been successfully diagnosed and fixed. The main issue was that approved clock-in and clock-out requests were not showing on the employee calendar due to backend integration problems.

## 🔧 PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### 1. Backend Code Synchronization Issues
- **Problem**: Docker container was running outdated backend code
- **Fix**: Force rebuilt backend container with `--no-cache` flag multiple times
- **Verification**: Confirmed container is running latest code

### 2. Database Column Name Mismatches
- **Problem**: Backend code referenced non-existent columns (`request_id`, `reviewed_by`)
- **Fix**: Updated all references to use correct column names (`id`, `admin_id`)
- **Files Updated**: `backend/routes/users.js`, `backend/routes/admin.js`

### 3. Authentication Bug
- **Problem**: Login route referenced `user.password_hash` instead of `user.password`
- **Fix**: Updated authentication logic in `backend/routes/auth.js`

### 4. Test Script Date Format Issues
- **Problem**: Test script couldn't find attendance records due to date format mismatch
- **Fix**: Updated date comparison logic to handle ISO date formats
