# üîç Critical Findings from Your Logs

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- Application startup successful
- Socket.IO connected
- Redis properly falling back to DB
- Workers initialized

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **MISSING DATABASE CONNECTION LOGS**
**Problem:** Your logs show NO database connection attempts
- No "Connecting to database..." messages
- No PostgreSQL connection errors
- This suggests database environment variables aren't loaded

### 2. **Memory Issues**
```
üö® Memory alert: 31.88MB / 34.11MB (94.2%)
```
Your container is running out of memory

### 3. **Environment Variables Not Visible**
Normal startup logs should show:
```
DB_HOST: attendance-db
DB_PORT: 5432
DB_NAME: attendance_dashboard
```
But we don't see these.

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables in Coolify
1. **Go to your application in Coolify**
2. **Check "Environment Variables" section**
3. **Verify these are set:**
   ```
   DB_HOST=attendance-db
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=attendance_dashboard
   DB_USER=attendance_user
   DB_PASSWORD=[your password]
   DB_SSL=false
   JWT_SECRET=[your secret]
   ```

### Step 2: Check PostgreSQL Service Status
1. **In Coolify, check if PostgreSQL service exists**
2. **Verify it's running** (not stopped/failed)
3. **Check PostgreSQL service logs** for SSL errors

### Step 3: Restart Application
After confirming environment variables:
1. **Restart your application** in Coolify
2. **Check new startup logs** for database connection attempts

## üîç What We Need to See Next

**Expected logs after fixes:**
```
‚úÖ Environment variables loaded
‚úÖ Connecting to database: attendance-db:5432
‚úÖ Database connected successfully
‚úÖ Server ready on port 3002
```

**OR error logs showing specific database issues:**
```
‚ùå Database connection failed: ECONNREFUSED
‚ùå PostgreSQL not responding on attendance-db:5432
```

## üö® Most Likely Issues

1. **Environment variables not configured in Coolify**
2. **PostgreSQL service doesn't exist or is stopped**
3. **Wrong database service name** (not "attendance-db")

---
**Check environment variables first - that's likely the root cause!**
