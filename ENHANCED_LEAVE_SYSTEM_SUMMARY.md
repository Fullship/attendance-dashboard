# Enhanced Leave Management System - Business Rules Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a comprehensive leave management system with 10 specific business rules that transform the original 21-day vacation system into a sophisticated 24-day semi-annual tracking system with advanced business logic.

## Implemented Business Rules

### 1. **Annual Vacation Allocation - 24 Days**
- **Implementation**: Changed from 21 to 24 vacation days annually
- **Location**: `enhanced-leave.js` - `leaveAllocations.vacation.annual: 24`
- **Semi-Annual Split**: 12 days per period (Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec)
- **Database Tracking**: `semi_annual_leave_tracking` table tracks usage per period

### 2. **Semi-Annual Vacation Reset**
- **Implementation**: Vacation days reset every 6 months
- **Logic**: getCurrentSemiAnnual() function determines current period
- **Tracking**: Separate balance tracking for each semi-annual period
- **Reset Mechanism**: Admin endpoint `/admin/reset-semi-annual` for period transitions

### 3. **Admin-Approved Sick Leave**
- **Implementation**: All sick leave requires admin approval
- **Location**: `leaveAllocations.sick.requiresApproval: true`
- **Workflow**: Sick leave requests automatically flagged for admin review
- **Approval Process**: Admin review modal with approval/rejection options

### 4. **Maternity Leave Structure (90 Days)**
- **Implementation**: 60 days basic pay + 30 days work from home
- **Location**: `leaveAllocations.maternity` with detailed breakdown
- **Description**: "2 months basic pay + 1 month work from home"
- **Total Allocation**: 90 days with structured periods

### 5. **Management Approval for Extended Leave**
- **Implementation**: Leave requests > 3 days require management approval
- **Logic**: `requiresManagementApproval` flag set for extended requests
- **Category**: Automatically categorized as 'extended' leave
- **Workflow**: Enhanced approval process for longer periods

### 6. **Working Week Definition (Sunday-Thursday)**
- **Implementation**: isWorkingDay() function validates working days
- **Validation**: Prevents leave requests on Friday/Saturday
- **Business Hours**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM documented
- **Lunch Break**: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM (max 45 minutes)

### 7. **Maximum 5 Consecutive Working Days**
- **Implementation**: calculateBusinessDays() function enforces limit
- **Validation**: Client and server-side validation for max 5 days
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for violations
- **Logic**: Only counts working days (Sunday-Thursday)

### 8. **Team Leave Capacity Limit (49%)**
- **Implementation**: checkTeamLeaveCapacity() function
- **Logic**: Maximum 49% of team members can be on leave simultaneously
- **Database**: Real-time checking against existing approved leaves
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies specific dates with capacity issues

### 9. **Weekend Leave Restrictions (2 per Semi-Annual)**
- **Implementation**: Weekend leave tracking for Thursday/Sunday
- **Limit**: Maximum 2 weekend leaves per semi-annual period
- **Tracking**: `weekend_leaves_used` column in tracking table
- **Validation**: isWeekendWorkingDay() function identifies weekend working days

### 10. **Enhanced Leave Categories**
- **Implementation**: Automatic categorization system
- **Categories**: regular, medical, family, extended
- **Logic**: Based on leave type and duration
- **Tracking**: `leave_category` column for reporting and analytics

## Database Schema Enhancements

### New Tables Created
1. **semi_annual_leave_tracking**
   - Tracks vacation and weekend leave usage per semi-annual period
   - Primary key: (user_id, semi_annual_period, year)
   - Columns: vacation_days_used, weekend_leaves_used

2. **team_leave_slots**
   - Manages team capacity allocation
   - Tracks team-level leave planning

3. **company_holidays**
   - Centralized holiday management
   - Admin-controlled holiday calendar

### Enhanced leave_requests Table
- Added `semi_annual_period` column
- Added `leave_category` column  
- Added `is_weekend_leave` boolean
- Added `team_conflict_check` boolean
