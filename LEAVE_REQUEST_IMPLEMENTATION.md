# Leave Request Feature Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive leave request management system for your attendance dashboard with the following key features:

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
✅ **Leave Requests Table** created with:
- Complete leave request lifecycle (pending → approved/rejected/cancelled)
- Support for full-day and half-day leaves
- Emergency contact information
- Supporting document uploads
- Admin review workflow
- Comprehensive validation constraints

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### Employee Endpoints (`/api/leave/`)
- `GET /my-leave-requests` - View own leave requests with filtering
- `POST /leave-request` - Submit new leave request with file upload
- `GET /leave-balance` - Check remaining leave days by type
- `DELETE /leave-request/:id` - Cancel pending requests
- `GET /attendance-analysis` - View attendance patterns for leave justification

#### Admin Endpoints (`/api/admin/`)
- `GET /leave-requests` - View all leave requests with advanced filtering
- `PUT /leave-requests/:id/review` - Approve/reject leave requests
- `GET /leave-requests/stats` - Leave statistics and analytics
- `GET /leave-balance/:userId` - View any employee's leave balance

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Employee Interface (`LeaveManagement.tsx`)
- **Leave Balance Dashboard** - Visual cards showing remaining days for each leave type
- **Request Form** - Comprehensive form with:
  - Leave type selection (vacation, sick, personal, emergency, maternity, paternity, bereavement)
  - Date range picker with business day calculation
  - Half-day support (morning/afternoon)
  - Reason and emergency contact fields
  - Supporting document upload
- **Request History** - Track all submitted requests with status updates
- **Smart Validation** - Prevent overlapping requests and check leave balance

#### Admin Interface (`AdminLeaveManagement.tsx`)
- **Statistics Dashboard** - Overview of all leave requests and trends
- **Request Management** - Review, approve, or reject pending requests
- **Advanced Filtering** - Filter by status, type, location, team, date range
- **Employee Leave Balance View** - Check any employee's remaining leave
- **Bulk Operations** - Handle multiple requests efficiently

### 4. Attendance Pattern Analysis

Based on your observations, the system includes:

#### Automatic Violation Detection
- **Late Arrival**: Flags clock-in after 9:30 AM
- **Early Leave**: Flags clock-out before 4:30 PM (16:30)
- **Irregular Entries**: Flags very late clock-outs (after 22:00)
- **Absent Days**: Identifies days with no attendance records
- **Multiple Entry Patterns**: Detects unusual attendance patterns

#### Smart Recommendations
The system provides automated recommendations based on attendance patterns:
- Low attendance rate warnings
- Punctuality improvement suggestions
- Workload review recommendations for frequent early departures
- Overtime authorization verification for irregular patterns

### 5. Business Rules Implementation

#### Leave Balance Management
- **Standard Allocations**:
  - Vacation: 21 days
  - Sick: 10 days
  - Personal: 3 days
  - Emergency: 2 days
  - Maternity: 90 days
  - Paternity: 14 days
  - Bereavement: 5 days

#### Validation Rules
- Prevent overlapping leave requests
- Ensure sufficient leave balance
- Validate date ranges and business day calculations
- Half-day leave constraints (single day only)
- File upload security (PDF, DOC, images only, 5MB limit)

### 6. Integration with Existing System

The leave request system integrates seamlessly with your existing attendance system:
- Uses the same user authentication and authorization
- Connects to existing user, location, and team data
- Maintains consistency with attendance records
- Follows the same admin/employee role structure

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend Files
1. `/backend/routes/leave.js` - Employee leave endpoints
2. `/backend/admin-leave-endpoints.js` - Admin leave endpoints (to be added to admin.js)
3. Database migration - `leave_requests` table creation

### Frontend Components
1. `/frontend/src/components/LeaveManagement.tsx` - Employee interface
2. `/frontend/src/components/AdminLeaveManagement.tsx` - Admin interface

### Configuration
- Updated `server.js` to include leave routes
- Database schema with proper indexes and constraints

## Usage Instructions

### For Employees
1. Navigate to Leave Management section
2. View current leave balance by type
3. Click "Request Leave" to submit new request
4. Fill in details, upload supporting documents if needed
5. Track request status and admin feedback
6. Cancel pending requests if needed

### For Admins
1. Access Leave Management from admin dashboard
2. View statistics and trends
3. Filter requests by various criteria
4. Review pending requests with employee details
5. Approve/reject with notes
6. Monitor leave balance across all employees

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:
1. Add the admin endpoints from `admin-leave-endpoints.js` to `admin.js`
2. Add leave management navigation links to your existing UI
3. Configure email notifications for request status updates
4. Set up automated reports for leave trends
5. Integrate with payroll system if needed

The foundation is complete and ready for integration into your existing attendance dashboard!
