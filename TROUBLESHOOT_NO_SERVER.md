   - Is it showing "Stopped" or "Failed" (red)?

2. **Deployment Logs:**
   - Click on your application
   - Check "Build Logs" or "Deployment Logs"
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Runtime Status:**
   - Check if container is running
   - Look at runtime logs for errors

### Step 2: Verify PostgreSQL Database

- Did you add the required environment variables to PostgreSQL?
- Is it in the same project as your application?
