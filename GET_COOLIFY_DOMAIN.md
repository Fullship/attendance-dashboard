# 🎯 Step 1: Get Your Coolify Domain

## The "no available server" error means we need to find your actual Coolify domain first.

### 📍 How to Find Your Coolify Domain

**Follow these steps in your Coolify dashboard:**

1. **Go to Coolify Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Projects**
3. **Select your project** (or create new project)
4. **Create Application:**
   - Source: GitHub Repository
   - Repository: `Fullship/attendance-dashboard`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build Pack: Dockerfile
   - **DON'T add custom domain yet**

5. **After creating application, look for:**
   - **"Generated URL"** or **"Preview URL"**
   - **"Application URL"** in the dashboard
   - Something like: `attendance-dashboard-xyz123.your-coolify-instance.com`

### 📝 Once You Have the Domain

**Reply with your Coolify-generated domain, and I'll update all the configuration files accordingly.**

Example domains might look like:
- `app-12345.coolify.example.com`
- `attendance-dashboard.your-server.com`
- `nervous-rabbit-123.coolify.io`

### 🚀 What Happens Next

Once you provide the domain, I'll:
1. ✅ Update environment variables with correct API URL
2. ✅ Update all configuration files
3. ✅ Provide exact copy-paste environment variables
4. ✅ Guide you through the complete deployment
