Go to your organization's GitHub and create a new repository:

**Repository Details:**
- **Name**: `attendance-dashboard` or `employee-attendance-system`
- **Description**: Enterprise Employee Attendance Management System with Leave Management
- **Visibility**: Private (recommended) or Public

```bash
# Add your organization's repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/attendance-dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)

In GitHub repository settings:
- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Branches**
- Add rule for `main` branch:
  - ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
  - ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - ‚úÖ Include administrators

## üîß Repository Configuration

### 4. Configure Secrets (for CI/CD)

In **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**, add:

```bash
# Database secrets (for testing)
DB_PASSWORD_TEST=your_test_db_password
