 *
 * — GitHub Copilot Prompt Start —
 * 
 *  Goal:
 *   Build a modern, accessible, mobile‑responsive career page in React (or Next.js)
 *   with the following sections and features:
 *
 * Technology & Architecture:
 *   • Use Functional React components with Hooks (JavaScript or TypeScript).
 *   • If on Next.js: export as `export default function CareersPage()` and
 *     include `<Head>` tags for SEO/OG.
 *   • Use a component-based structure: e.g. Hero, CompanyIntro, JobList,
 *     Filters, Testimonials, Benefits, FAQs, ApplicationForm, Footer.
 *   • Use base CSS Modules or styled-components (feel free to scaffold both).
 *   • All visual assets should be structured for lazy loading
 *     (`next/image` or `<img loading="lazy">`).
 *
 * Sections & Features:
 *   1. Hero Banner
 *      • Headline and sub‑text introducing your mission or EVP (employee value proposition).
 *      • Background image of workplace/team.
 *      • CTA buttons: “See Open Roles” and “Join Talent Network”.
 *   2. Company Introduction (About Us / Culture)
 *      • Mission, vision, and values in concise paragraphs or bullets.
 *      • Brief “Our Culture” rows (e.g. small cards or icons).
 *   3. Employee Testimonials / Video Spotlight
 *      • Quote blocks or video spotlights (“A week in the life at Company”).
 *      • Provide props for name, role, photo, quote, or video embed.
 *   4. Benefits & Perks
 *      • List key benefits (e.g. flexibility, training, healthcare, equity).
 *      • Show interactive/toggle cards or icons.
 *   5. Job Listings Section
 *      • Fetch open roles via `jobs.json` or REST API.
 *      • Display in a paginated table or cards: title, department, location, type.
 *      • Add filters: department, location, job type.
 *   6. Apply Now Form Component
 *      • Fields: Name *, Email *, Resume upload (PDF), Cover letter, Location.
 *      • Client‑side validation: required fields, email format, file size/type.
 *      • After submit: show inline confirmation and reset form.
 *   7. FAQ Section About Hiring Process
 *      • Collapsible Q&A items about “How we hire”, remote roles, equal opportunity.
 *   8. SEO & Social Sharing
 *      • Automatically insert `<meta>` tags for page title, description, OG:image,
 *        Twitter card.
 *      • Content should include structured data (JSON‑LD for JobPosting, Organization).
 *   9. Accessibility
 *      • Keyboard focus states, ARIA roles, skip‑nav link.
 *      • High contrast text, WCAG‑compliant fonts and colors.
 *  10. Analytics Hooks
 *      • Add optional Google Tag, Mixpanel, or Matomo event hook at “Apply Now” click.
 *
 * UI / Visual Guidance:
 *   • Use clean, modular headlined sections.
 *   • Keep the layout responsive with flex/grid and appropriate breakpoints.
 *   • Allow easy customization of theme via CSS variables or theme file.
 *
 * Testing (optional / when cod ed):
 *   • Provide Jest or React Testing Library tests for:
 *     — JobList renders mock roles.
 *     — Filters update list.
 *     — Form validation error message appears when missing input.
 *
 * Additional Notes for Copilot:
 *   • Generate each component in its own file in `components/`.
 *   • Provide Prop Interface/Icon and `export default`.
 *   • After the initial scaffold, ask: “Now add real data mocks, style with Tailwind or Material UI,” etc.
