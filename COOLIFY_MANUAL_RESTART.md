# üöÄ Manual Coolify Restart Guide

## The CSP Fix Has Been Deployed But May Need Manual Restart

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Code changes pushed to GitHub (CSP disabled in helmet)
- ‚ùå Coolify might not have auto-deployed or deployment stuck
- ‚ùå React app still showing blank page due to CSP

### Manual Fix in Coolify Dashboard:

#### Option 1: Force Restart Application
1. Go to your **Coolify dashboard**
2. Navigate to your **attendance-dashboard** application
3. Click **"Restart"** or **"Force Restart"**
4. Wait for restart to complete (2-3 minutes)

#### Option 2: Force Redeploy
1. In Coolify dashboard, go to your application
2. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"**
3. This will pull latest code and rebuild
4. Wait for deployment to complete

#### Option 3: Check Deployment Status
1. In Coolify, check **"Deployments"** or **"Logs"**
2. Look for any failed deployments
3. Check if auto-deployment is enabled

### Quick Test After Restart:
```bash
# Test if CSP is removed (should not show content-security-policy header)
curl -I https://my.fullship.net/ | grep -i content-security

# Test if React loads
curl -s https://my.fullship.net/ | grep -o '<div id="root">'
```

### Expected Results:
- ‚ùå **No CSP headers** from helmet (CSP disabled)
- ‚úÖ **React app loads** instead of blank page
- ‚úÖ **Frontend functionality** works normally

### What the Fix Does:
```javascript
// OLD: Restrictive CSP that blocked React
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"], // ‚Üê This blocked inline scripts
  }
}

// NEW: CSP completely disabled
contentSecurityPolicy: false // ‚Üê No CSP restrictions
```

### If Still Not Working:
1. **Check Coolify auto-deployment settings**
2. **Manual restart** is usually the quickest solution
3. **Check Coolify logs** for any deployment errors

**The fix is ready - just needs Coolify to deploy it!** üéØ
