# CORS Issue Resolution - Production Frontend API Configuration

## Issue Summary
The frontend was working but couldn't log in due to CORS errors. The console showed:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:3002/socket.io/...' from origin 'https://my.fullship.net' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Root Cause
The frontend React app was built with hardcoded localhost URLs instead of the production domain. Even though the code used `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`, this environment variable was not being set during the Docker build process.

## Files Affected
- **Frontend API Configuration**: All API calls were pointing to `http://localhost:3002` instead of `https://my.fullship.net`
- **Socket.IO Configuration**: WebSocket connections were also trying to connect to localhost
- **Docker Build Process**: Missing `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Before (missing API URL)
RUN cd frontend && \
    NODE_ENV=production \
    GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false \
    npm run build

# After (with correct API URL)
RUN cd frontend && \
    NODE_ENV=production \
    GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false \
    REACT_APP_API_URL=https://my.fullship.net/api \
    npm run build
```

### 2. Created Frontend Production Environment
- Added `frontend/.env.production` with correct API URL
- Sets `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://my.fullship.net/api`

### 3. Added Testing Scripts
- `test-production-cors.sh`: Verify API endpoints and CORS headers
- `fix-cors-production.sh`: Automated fix script for future deployments

## Expected Result
After Coolify rebuilds the application:
- ✅ Frontend will connect to `https://my.fullship.net/api` instead of `localhost:3002`
- ✅ Socket.IO will connect to `https://my.fullship.net` instead of `localhost:3002`
- ✅ All CORS errors should be resolved
- ✅ Login and authentication should work properly

## Verification Steps
1. Wait for Coolify deployment to complete
2. Open https://my.fullship.net in browser
3. Open Developer Tools → Network tab
4. Try logging in
5. Verify API calls go to `https://my.fullship.net/api/*` not `localhost:3002`

## Technical Details
- **Frontend Build Time**: Environment variables are baked into the React build
- **Production Domain**: https://my.fullship.net
- **API Endpoint**: https://my.fullship.net/api
- **WebSocket**: https://my.fullship.net/socket.io

This fix ensures the frontend and backend communicate properly in production environment.
